### ðŸŒˆ Hiya I'm Chris!

I enjoy using React and its friends for building stuff. I'm currently working on my first open source project [redwoodjs-stripe](https://github.com/chrisvdm/redwoodjs-stripe), an integration package between Redwood and Stripe. 

If you'd like to say hi you can email me at <chrsvdmrw@gmail.com>
